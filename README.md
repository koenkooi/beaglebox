After shorting out yet another board I decided to make some coasters to protect my revision B and revision C beagleboards. It took me a few hours to get the hang of openscad and then tweak the dimensions to account for ABS shrinkage, but it's finally working.

There are design for the BeagleBoard Classic, BeagleBoard xM and BeagleBone Ax.
